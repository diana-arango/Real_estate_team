### **Topic:** 
Real Estate – USA Rental Market

### **Reason:**
 The reason we chose real estate was to gain an understating of how certain factors impact the rental price of a property. Our model analyzes how location, building type, square footage, number of bedrooms and being pet friendly can affect rental price. Our goal is to predict what the rental price would be for a particular property given its features. This information can then be used by real estate professionals, landlords, tenants, or someone who is considering purchasing an investment property. 

### **Description of Data Source:** 
The data source we chose was a CSV file from Kaggle which contains over 300,000 rental listings on Craigslist. This dataset contains a total of 22 columns with various categorical and numerical data about the rental property such as listing ID, address, various property features, rental price, longitude, latitude and more. 

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/usa-housing-listings

* 9 integer  
* 6 string  
* 3 url


### **Questions we hope to answer with data:**
Does the location affect rental price?  

  * Which regions have the most expensive rental prices?  
  * Which regions have the most affordable rental prices?

How does allowing pets impact rental price?

How does building type affect rental price?

How does square footage affect rental price?

Ultimately, our goal is to be able to predict the rental price for given property given its features.
